# Cizelge App
This is a simple scheduling application I made for my brother. It uses [CalendarCarousel](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_calendar_carousel) plugin for the Calendar widget and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/) to store the selected dates.

## What does it do?
This is an app which you can share your work schedule with your coworkers, this is especially useful for healthcare workers because their schedule changes frequently, and instead of writing the schedule down to paper, they can mark it on the calendar and other workers can see when they work.
