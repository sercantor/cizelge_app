# Cizelge App

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a simple scheduling application I made for my brother. It uses Calendar Carousel and Flutter Notifications plugin. The application saves the dates that the user has chosen and sends a notification according to the date. The dates are stored with the help of shared preferences plugin.

## What does it do?
My brother complained that there is no simple application which you can just select dates on a calendar and not deal with configuring stuff, he works in a hospital so with this application he can just mark the dates and it will notify him about when his next night shift is.
